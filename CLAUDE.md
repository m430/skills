Skills are organized into bucket folders under `skills/`:

- `design/`: interface and design-system work
- `engineering/`: daily code work
- `productivity/`: daily non-code workflow tools
- `misc/`: kept around but rarely used, not promoted

Every skill in `design/`, `engineering/` or `productivity/` (the **promoted** buckets) must have a reference in the top-level `README.md` and an entry in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s `skills` array (the Claude Code plugin ships exactly the promoted set). Skills in `misc/` must not appear in either.

Install commands are copied verbatim from [.agents/install-block.md](./.agents/install-block.md). `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` makes the repo its own single-plugin marketplace (a fallback the install block explains, not the documented route). Run `claude plugin validate . --strict` after touching either manifest. Why a Claude plugin but not (yet) a Codex one lives in [.agents/adr/0002-ship-as-a-claude-code-plugin.md](./.agents/adr/0002-ship-as-a-claude-code-plugin.md).

Each skill entry in the top-level `README.md` must link the skill name to its `SKILL.md`.

Each bucket folder has a `README.md` that lists every skill in the bucket with a one-line description, with the skill name linked to its `SKILL.md`. The promoted buckets' `README.md`s and the top-level `README.md` group entries into **User-invoked** and **Model-invoked**; the non-promoted bucket's `README.md` (`misc/`) uses a flat list.

Skills in the promoted buckets are documented by their own `SKILL.md` files; this repo keeps no separate human-facing docs tree.

Every `SKILL.md` is either user-invoked (`disable-model-invocation: true` plus `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` in `agents/openai.yaml`, reachable only by the human) or model-invoked (model- or user-reachable). See [.agents/invocation.md](./.agents/invocation.md).

When a skill asks the user to make a decision, it uses the harness's structured question tool (`AskUserQuestion`) whenever one is available: one question at a time, with candidate answers as options and the recommended one first. Fall back to plain-text questions when no such tool exists. See [grilling](./skills/productivity/grilling/SKILL.md) for the pattern.

To (re)link every skill outside `misc/` into the local harness skill directories (`~/.claude/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`), run `scripts/link-skills.sh`. Each entry is a symlink into this repo, so a `git pull` keeps installed skills current; re-run the script after adding, removing, or renaming a skill.

No em-dashes anywhere in this repo's prose (`SKILL.md` files, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, ADRs, changesets, code comments). Where a sentence reaches for one, rewrite it instead with a comma, colon, period, parentheses, or a conjunction, whichever the sentence actually wants; never do a blind character substitution.
